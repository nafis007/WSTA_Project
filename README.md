The aim of this project is to build a system for fact verification: 
the task of automatically validating whether a claim is true, false or unverifiable based on the information in a large text corpus. The problem requires finding sentences in the text corpus (here Wikipedia) which relate to the query claim, and then use this evidence to predict the validity of the claim.
