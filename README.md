Due to the massive growth of internet technologies
and social media usage, the amount of textual
information and facts are increasing rapidly over the
internet. Proving the authenticity of these contents
becomes a major concern, specially because of the
significant increase of fake news and articles on the
internet in recent times. But, considering the huge
amount of information available on the internet,
manual fact verification is quite infeasible. These
is where the need for automatic fact verification
system rises, to use and share the contents on the
internet, with ease and reliability. To accomplish this
task, a system needs to be developed, which can
retrieve some relevant documents, and also some
relevant sentences, based on the given claim, and
finally, will need to provide a decision label for
the claim, stating whether it supports or refutes
it, based on those retrieved relevant documents
and sentences. It can provide a neutral feedback,
if enough information is not found regarding the
claim.

My Contribution was pre-processing the data in multiple stages, to integrate with AllenNLP library, and also optimizing the data structure code for time efficiency. I was also involved in retrieving relevant evidence using the pre-processed data.
